# img2spec - Image to Spectrogram Audio Generator

Convert images (PNG/JPG) into audio by interpreting them as spectrograms. Uses the Griffin-Lim algorithm for phase reconstruction and ISTFT for high-quality audio synthesis.

## Download & Installation

### Pre-built Binaries (Recommended)

**Coming Soon**: Pre-built releases will be available on the [Releases page](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/img2spec/releases).

For now, please build from source (see below).

## Technology Stack

- **GUI**: Qt6 (cross-platform UI)
- **FFT**: kissfft (lightweight, BSD license)
- **Audio I/O**: libsndfile (supports all PCM formats)
- **Image loading**: stb_image (PNG/JPG support)

## Build from Source

### macOS Requirements

```bash
# Install Qt6
brew install qt6

# Install libsndfile (optional, will be fetched if not found)
brew install libsndfile

# Install CMake (if needed)
brew install cmake
```

### Windows Requirements

1. Install Qt6 from https://www.qt.io/download
2. Install CMake from https://cmake.org/download/
3. Install Visual Studio 2019 or later with C++ support

#### macOS Build Steps

```bash
# Clone the repository
cd /path/to/img2spec

# Create build directory
mkdir build
cd build

# Configure (specify Qt6 path if needed)
cmake .. -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/opt/homebrew/opt/qt@6

# Build
cmake --build . --config Release

# Run
./img2spec
```

#### Windows Build Steps (Visual Studio)

```bash
# Open Developer Command Prompt
cd C:\path\to\img2spec

# Create build directory
mkdir build
cd build

# Configure (specify Qt6 path)
cmake .. -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=C:\Qt\6.x.x\msvc2019_64

# Build
cmake --build . --config Release

# Run
Release\img2spec.exe
```

## Usage

### Quick Start

1. **Launch the application**:
   ```bash
   ./build/img2spec.app/Contents/MacOS/img2spec
   ```

2. **Open Image**:
   - **Method 1**: Click "Open Image..." and select a PNG or JPG file
   - **Method 2**: Drag and drop an image file onto the application window
   - Color images are automatically converted to grayscale
   - Alpha channel is ignored
   - Preview appears in the window

3. **Review Audio Duration**:
   - The estimated output duration is displayed below the parameters
   - Calculated based on: `(Image Width × Hop Size) / Sample Rate`
   - Adjust hop size and sample rate to control duration

4. **Adjust Parameters**: Configure settings for your desired output
   - Start with defaults for first test
   - Recommended settings for good quality:
     - Sample Rate: 48000 Hz
     - Bit Depth: 24 bit (PCM)
     - FFT Size: 2048
     - Hop Size: NFFT/4
     - Frequency Scale: Logarithmic
     - Min Freq: 20 Hz, Max Freq: 20000 Hz
     - Griffin-Lim Iterations: 64

5. **Frequency Guides** (Logarithmic mode only):
   - Visual guides show frequency positions on the image
   - Common frequencies marked: 50Hz, 100Hz, 200Hz, 500Hz, 1kHz, 2kHz, 5kHz, 10kHz, 15kHz
   - Helps understand which parts of the image correspond to which frequencies

6. **Render**: Click "Render & Export WAV..."
   - Choose save location for WAV file
   - Progress dialog shows detailed rendering status:
     - Spectrogram building
     - Griffin-Lim iterations (with count)
     - Post-processing
     - WAV file writing
   - Success dialog displays when complete

7. **Listen**: Open the generated WAV file in any audio player or DAW

### Parameter Guide

- **FFT Size**: Larger = better frequency resolution, longer processing
- **Hop Size**: Smaller = smoother time resolution, longer audio duration
- **Frequency Scale**:
  - **Linear**: Direct pixel-to-bin mapping (uniform frequency distribution)
  - **Logarithmic**: Perceptual mapping (more resolution in low frequencies)
- **Min Freq / Max Freq**: Frequency range for logarithmic mapping (20Hz - 20kHz default)
- **Min dB**: Controls dynamic range (black pixel amplitude)
- **Gamma**: Brightness curve (>1 = brighter, <1 = darker)
- **Griffin-Lim Iterations**: More = better phase estimation (diminishing returns >64)
- **Normalize Target**: Peak level in dBFS (recommended: -1 dBFS)
- **Output Gain**: Additional volume adjustment
- **Safety Limiter**: Prevents clipping with soft limiting

- 32-bit output is Float32 format (not Int32)

## License

This project uses:
- Qt6: LGPL v3
- kissfft: BSD
- libsndfile: LGPL v2.1+
- stb_image: Public Domain

## Troubleshooting

### Build Issues

**Qt6 not found**:
```bash
cmake .. -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/path/to/qt6
```

**libsndfile not found**: CMake will automatically fetch it via FetchContent

### Runtime Issues

**"Failed to load image"**: Ensure image is valid PNG/JPG
**"Render failed"**: Check console output for detailed error messages
